# Python-Scripts
A collection of scripts I wrote in Python for various actions


# API POST request tester
- This is an example POST request to test the functionality of an internal API.
- If the login was successful, it would return the API Session ID.
- This was built as an excercise during a coding interview.



# GithubRepoChecker
- This script will automatically check which teams exist within a GitHub organization.
- You supply a list of repositories to check within a Repos.txt file, the script will check each one and return a list of teams.



# URL Unshortener
- This is a URL Unshortening tool that I wrote.
- The tool runs from the commandline, no installation needed.
- Use -v for verbose output to display the complete route.
- Colour coding only works on Linux systems.



# Web Scraping Example
- This is an example script that I wrote, for use of an internally developed tool.
- The page that would be scraped would display a randomly generated password, this script would only return the password which could be used in other scripts.
